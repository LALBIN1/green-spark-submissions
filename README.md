# 🧼 CleanZone – Waste Reporting & Bin Locator

## 📖 Project Overview

**CleanZone** is a web-based platform built to promote a cleaner and smarter urban environment. It empowers citizens to actively participate in waste management by allowing them to report the type of waste they want to dispose of and view nearby public waste bin locations on a map.

The goal is to simplify waste reporting and disposal by:
- Giving users an easy way to request pickup of waste from their location
- Showing real-time locations of different types of public waste bins (plastic, organic, e-waste, etc.)
- Reducing littering by providing quick disposal options
- Assisting municipal bodies with smarter waste collection routing

CleanZone runs entirely in the browser with no backend required for basic functionality, and it uses open-source tools to avoid paid APIs, making it lightweight, scalable, and 100% free to use or modify.

## 🚩 How the Problem Statement Is Addressed

**Problem:**  
Urban environments suffer from waste mismanagement, illegal dumping, and lack of public awareness about where to properly dispose of different types of waste. Citizens often don’t know:
- Where to find public waste bins
- How to report their waste responsibly
- Whether their local authorities can assist

**CleanZone solves this by:**
- Providing a **form-based system** where users can report the type of waste they have, along with their location and contact details
- Displaying a **map with real-time bin locations**, categorized by waste type (organic, plastic, e-waste, etc.)
- Using **color-coded markers** to make it easy to visually identify the right disposal point
- Making everything **accessible and mobile-friendly**, so anyone can use it with no special app or account
- Using **free open-source map tools** (Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap), removing financial barriers to deployment

This approach reduces friction between the public and waste management systems and encourages greater civic responsibility.
